    PLANS:
    • Plan I — 6 Months: ₹499 (₹83.2/month)
    • Plan II — 1 Year: ₹799 (₹66.6/month) — most economical

    BENEFITS:

    • Agent must explain this clearly if customer asks about "missing" coins after membership purchase

    SAVINGS PROJECTION:
    • Assumption: 1 order/month of ₹5,000 with yearly plan
    • Monthly reward benefit: ~₹125
    • Monthly free delivery saving: ~₹100
