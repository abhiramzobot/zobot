# --- ORDER MANAGEMENT ---

- question: "How do I track my order?"
  answer: |
    You can track your order by providing your phone number or order number. I'll look up the latest tracking information including AWB number, courier partner, and real-time delivery status.
    You can also track directly at dentalkart.com/account/my-order/v2

- question: "When will my order be delivered? / Mera order kab aayega?"
  answer: |
    I can check the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) for your order. Please share your order number or registered phone number.
    If your order hasn't shipped yet, I'll share the expected ship-by date. If shipped, I'll provide the tracking status and expected delivery date from the courier partner.

- question: "My order is delayed / Order nahi mila"
  answer: |
    I'm sorry about the delay! Let me check the current status. If the estimated delivery date has passed, I'll escalate this to our logistics team for priority handling.
    Please share your order number so I can look into this immediately.

  answer: |
    I'll look up your order status right away. Please share your registered phone number or order number.
    I can tell you the current status (processing, shipped, out for delivery, delivered), tracking details, and estimated delivery date.
  tags: [order status, check order, where is order, status check]
  category: orders

- question: "My order shows delivered but I haven't received it"
  answer: |
    I understand that's concerning. Let me check the delivery details including proof of delivery.
    Sometimes packages are delivered to a neighbor or security guard. If it's genuinely missing, I'll raise a POD (Proof of Delivery) request with our logistics team. This may take 5–7 working days for investigation. Please note this applies to prepaid orders only.
  tags: [not received, delivered, missing, lost, POD, proof of delivery, nahi mila]
  category: delivery

- question: "I received only some items, where's the rest?"
  answer: |
    Your order may have been shipped in multiple packages. Let me check the shipment details — if it's a multi-package shipment, I can track each package separately and share the delivery timeline for the remaining items.
  tags: [partial delivery, some items, missing items, incomplete, multi-package]
  category: delivery

- question: "Can I confirm if my order was placed successfully?"
  answer: |
    Let me check! I'll search using your registered phone number or email. I can confirm the order details including products, price, and expected shipping timeline.
    If your payment was received but order isn't showing, I'll escalate to our payment team for verification.

# --- CANCELLATION ---

- question: "How do I cancel my order? / Order cancel karna hai"
  answer: |
    Cancellation depends on your order status:
    • Before Packed/Shipped: Cancellation is possible. For COD orders, you can cancel directly from the app: Profile → My Orders → Expand → Cancel → Select reason → Submit
    • After Packed/Shipped: Cancellation is not possible. You'll need to refuse delivery at the doorstep, or accept and raise a return request.
    Please share your order number and I'll check the current status.
  tags: [cancel, cancellation, cancel karna hai, order cancel, stop order]
  category: orders

- question: "Can I cancel part of my order? / Partial cancellation"
  answer: |
    Partial cancellation is possible only before the order is packed. If the item hasn't been picked/packed yet, I can raise a partial cancellation request.
    If it's already packed, you'll need to accept delivery and raise a return for the unwanted items.
    Please share your order number and which item(s) you want to cancel.

    Once packed with a manifest number, address changes are no longer possible.
    Please share your order number and the new address details.
  tags: [address change, modify address, change delivery, wrong address]
  category: orders

- question: "Can I modify my order? / Add or change products"
  answer: |

    • Product replacement is allowed only if status is Allocated or Confirmed.
    • Beyond these stages, modifications aren't possible.
    Please share your order number and what changes you need.

- question: "How do reward points / coins work? / Reward coins kaise use karu?"
  answer: |
    Dentalkart Reward Coins system:

    **Earning Coins:**
    • You earn reward coins on every purchase
    • Coin value depends on your membership status:
      - **Plus Members:** 1 Coin = ₹1 (double value!)
      - **Non-Members:** 1 Coin = ₹0.50

    **Using Coins:**
    • Coins can be redeemed to reduce your order total at checkout
    • They work alongside other discounts and coupons

    **Important Note:**
    • When you purchase a Plus Membership, existing reward points get halved in quantity — but their VALUE remains the same because each coin is now worth ₹1 instead of ₹0.50.
    • Example: 200 coins at ₹0.50 = ₹100 → becomes 100 coins at ₹1 = ₹100 (same value!)
